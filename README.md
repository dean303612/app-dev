# The 100 - My Favorite Series

**The 100** is one of my favorite TV shows. It’s super exciting and keeps you interested the whole time. There are a lot of episodes, so it takes some time to watch, but it’s definitely worth it!

The story is really good and has lots of surprises. The characters change and grow a lot, and it’s easy to get attached to them. The actors are great and really make the show feel real.

If you like shows with action, drama, and suspense, I definitely recommend **The 100**!
